# Dish

Dish is a mobile app that croudsources opinions on individual dishes at restaurants to help people be more informed when looking at a menu and help ensure people order something that they're happy with more often.

The app is centered around photos first and reviews second for each dish, which is a decision made due to prior research on the problem.

## Todo/User Stories

### Menu

#### First Goals
 
* I can view a list of menu items.

* The menu items are organized into groups.

* I can tap a menu item to see more information. (picture, review scores)

* The list of menu items is generated from somewhere. (database, JSON)

#### Second Goals

* I can review a dish.

* I can view photos of a dish.

* I can add photos to a dish.

#### Additional Goals

* I can search for a dish from the menu.

### Restaurants
* I can switch between restaurants.

* I can add missing restaurants. (?)

* I can search for a dish at various restaurants.

## Design

### Menu

* I can easily look through the menu on my phone to find an item I am looking at on the restaurant's menu.

* Popular or Reccomended menu items are highlighted and easy to find on the menu.

* When looking at an item, the photos grab the majority of my attention.

* Reviewing a dish is easy.

* Reviewing a dish feels rewarding/meaningful.

### Restaurants

* I can easily select a location I am at.

## Evaluation / Further research

* Can we implement multiple types of reviews/user interfaces to get people's opinions between them?

* How will we design the interface of the app to be most usable? How might it change from our prototype?
